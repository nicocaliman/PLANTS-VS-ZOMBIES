Based on the videogame, I´ve been developing a short version of itself.

Plants VS Zombies was designed to be a "TOWER DEFENSE" videogame, a subgenre of strategy games where
the goal is to defend a player´s territories by obstructing the enemy attackers.

In this version, players still have to defend their suburban home from zombies. The loan is divided into a grid with the
player´s house to the left.
The player places different types of plants on individual cells of the grid. Each plant has different abilities to defend 
landlord´s menage.

IMPLEMENTED PLANTS:

  PEASHOOTER
  SUNFLOWER
