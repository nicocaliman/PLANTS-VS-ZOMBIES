Based on the videogame, I´ve been developing a short version of itself.

Plants VS Zombies was designed to be a "TOWER DEFENSE" videogame, a subgenre of strategy games where
the goal is to defend a player´s territories by obstructing the enemy attackers.

In this version, players still have to defend their suburban home from zombies. The loan is divided into a grid with the
player´s house to the left.
The player places different types of plants on individual cells of the grid. Each plant has different abilities to defend 
landlord´s menage (shooting, exploding, blocking).

From the other hand, we got different "breeds" of enemies such as buckethead, explosive & sporty zombies which have their own 
behaviors and their own weaknesses to different plants.
The player must pay to place plants using a currency called "Sun". The player collects "suns" by typing on the console the coordinates
where the sun is being placed, or he/she can pay for sunflowers, which will generate a specific amount of suns through rounds.

These suns will appear randomly across the land.
